          <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
        At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility -- as long as the subjects fall <br>
        somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated research, and just  <br>
        the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br>
        by are as follows, in order of priority:

         <ol>
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health  benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on preformance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30&deg;C (86&deg;F), when the <br>
                 audience size expontially increases (effect of 3x10<sup>3</sup> increasing 3x10 <sup>4</sup>) </li>
            <li><u>HTML</u>and<u>CSS</u> constructs for representing musical scores</li>
         </ol>
         So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,  including how long you'd expect the <br>
          research to take,requrid staff and other resouers,and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

       <h2>Exotic dance move</h2>
       Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your questions, <br>
       my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
       <dl>
        <dt>polynesian chicken dance</dt>
        <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as <b>300BC</b> a whole vilage would dance around <br>
        in circle like chicken, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
        <dd>Before the Inclanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br>
        involved huddling close together in a circle  on the floor, and shuffle thier bodies around in imperceptibly <br>
    tiny, very rapid movement. One of my fellow students used to say thah he thought this dance inspired <br> 
    modern style such as Twerking.</dd>
    <dt>Artic robot dance</dt>
    <dd>Before the Inclanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br>
        involved huddling close together in a circle  on the floor, and shuffle thier bodies around in imperceptibly <br>
    tiny, very rapid movement. One of my fellow students used to say thah he thought this dance inspired <br>
